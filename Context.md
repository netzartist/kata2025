1. **Vehicle availability**: "The right vehicles aren't in the right places" - need AI-driven demand prediction
2. **Battery management**: Prioritize which vehicles need charging/battery swaps to maximize availability
3. **Customer retention**: Convert ad-hoc tourist users into regular commuters/delivery customers
